# Antino-Hackathon-AI-wellness-companion - Aluma

## Overview

AI Powered mental health wellness and companion
Mental health issues are becoming more common in today’s fast-moving world.
Depression, anxiety, and stress affect millions of people, yet finding real support isn’t
always easy. <br>
The main idea is to build an ai
powered mental wellness/companion app in which I plan to include features like
building your own friend, professional therapy with an ai, guided meditation and a
community support for like-minded people.
